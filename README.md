# üêø gopher

A minimal go project bootstrapping tool.

    Usage:
      -init string
            bootstrap a new project with a given name
      -version
            display version number and exit
      -wrap
            build the project and zip it
     -make
            build the project using a Makefile, fall back on wrap
     -install
            install the project to user's private bin directory
     -scoop
            create a scoop manifest file for the project

## Using the tool

Currently gopher supports 3 actions.

### Create a new project

To create a new go project run:

    gopher -init name

This will:

- create a folder `name`
- inside it will:
  - run `go mod init name`
  - create `.gitignore` file
  - create `README.md` file
  - create `name.go` with simple hello world code
  - run `git init -b main`
 
### Compile the project and create a zip files for distribution

In most cases you should use the following command while in the project directory:

    gopher -make

If you do:

- Gopher will check if a `Makefile` exists in the project directory
- If it does, it will run the make command and execute the default build
- If there is no `Makefile`, it will use the gopher defaults instead

To build the project using the gopher defaults and skip Makefile even if one exists run:

    gopher -wrap

This must be run in the project directory. It will:

- cross compile the project for windows, mac and linux
- generate zip files for each os named `name_win.zip`, `name_mac.zip` and `name_lin.zip` respectively

Note that the `-make` switch does not generate any zip files and assumes any kind of packaging will be handled by your project Makefile.

### Generate a Scoop Manifest

To create a Scoop manifest (see [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh)) for the project run:

    gopher -scoop

This will generate `name.json` file that you can add to your scoop bucket. 

Don't forget to edit the description and verify all the details are correct before uploading the file.

### Installing

To install the project on your system run

    gopher -install

This will rebuild the project using `go build` and then copy the executable to your private user directory. This is `~/bin/` on mac/linux or `%USERPROFILE%\bin\` on windows. If such directory does not exist, gopher will bail out with an error.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: you must create the `bin` directory and add it to your `PATH` manually, gopher won't do that for you

## Examples

Sample screenshot of using `gopher` to create a go project, compile and wrap the executable into a zip file and generate a scoop manifest (all done in Powershell on Windows):

## Installing

 On Windows, this tool is distributed via `scoop` (see [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh)).

 First, you need to add my bucket:

    scoop bucket add maciak https://github.com/maciakl/bucket
    scoop update

 Next simply run:
 
    scoop install gopher

If you don't want to use `scoop` you can simply download the executable from the release page and extract it somewhere in your path.
